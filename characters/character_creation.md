# Character Creation
A character's personality and actions come from within, but at times during games there need to be rules that assist in defining a character's special abilities while fairly judging conflicted actions, such as game combat and how magic works.  For this reason, once a character is imagined, players choose from a set simple-to-remember **Virtues**, **Talents**, and **Abilities** that reflect that character's personal qualities and special in-game abilities.


## Character Creation Guide
There are a few simple steps for creating a new character:
  - Come up with an idea for the character, their strengths, their weaknesses, their goals, their history, and the their interesting qualities.
  - Choose the character's [Mythric Race](../races/races.md).
    * Choose **1** free Racial Ability for the race chosen.
  - Choose the character's **2** or **3** Virtues.  The number of Virtues for a game are determined by the Guides.
    * Each Virtue grants a choice **2** Talents from that Virtue type (Mind, Body, or Spirit).
    * Players can choose multiple Virtues from the same type such as choosing both of Mind's Virtues: Knowledge and Wisdom.
