# Mythric Races

Players start out by choosing their character's race which grants the character access to certain in-born Abilities.  Each of the races has their own unique origin and nature that related to the larger story of the mythic world and help players immerse themselves into their characters.

Each of the races have minor makeup requirements so others can tell each of the races apart and differentiate characters from other creatures like spirits, monsters, and otherworldly beings.

## Rules
  * Choose a race from the ones below and **1** free Racial Ability from that race's list.
  * Unless Racial Abilities note otherwise, they can only be used once every **2** hours.

### Enchanted Human
------
  * Racial Makeup: For each Racial Ability that Enchanted Humans have they must have at least one visible mark (makeup) somewhere above their shoulders or on their arms that represents the tie to that Racial Ability's theme Element: Earth, Water, or Wood.  This mark is an inborn birthmark and does not change between games.
  * There are non-Enchanted Humans that can be played by Guides and Wanderers, but all Pathfinders who want to play humans are considered Enchanted.

#### Racial Abilities:

  * **Elemental Earth: Body of Pure Jade**
    * After concentrating for at least a minute (no other activities can be done) and then saying "Body of Pure Jade" the character using this gains 5 points of **Toughness** against Wounds.
    * A character can never have more than 5 Toughness from this Ability at a time, but it will stack with Toughness from other sources.
  * **Elemental Water: Nixie Charm**
    * After talking to a character for at least 15 seconds, pointing at that person, and saying "Nixie Charm" (an out-of-play statement) the next few statements said by the character using the Charm will be taken in the best possible light by the person receiving the Nixie Charm.
    * Nobody is aware of a Nixie Charm being used.
    * Nixie Charm is not stopped by Mental protections.
  * **Elemental Wood: Rites of Renewal**
    * A character can touch another person and say "Rites of Renewal" which has the same effect as the Spirit Virtue's Weavings spell "**Phoenix's Flames**" Talent but it also removes any Mental effects and Maladies.  This Ability requires no time to activate but keeps the same drawbacks of **Phoenix's Flames**.
    * This ability can be used on the character themselves but only the resurrection aspect and takes 1 minute of being dead to activate then five minutes to complete along with the same drawbacks of **Phoenix's Flames** after the character returns to life.
    * This will often be a good choice for single-character games so that a character's death is not permanent and thus bringing an immediate end to the game.

### Secane
------
  * Pronounced: Seh-Khan-E
  * Racial Makeup: The player must apply makeup and/or prosthetics that make them appear feline (catlike).  Clip-on fabric cat ears that attach to the hair are a simple prosthetic that can be purchased online for under $5.

#### Racial Abilities:

  * **Short Claws**:
    * A Secane can have a set of two short claw boffers (under 20 inches), colored or taped red, that represent their natural feline claws.  
    * These claws can never be taken or broken and the character can keep them elsewhere when they are not in use (such as hung on a belt loop).
  * **Animal Empathy:**
    * The character can say calming words and make calming friendly motions to calm a small group of animals, even if the animals are being aggressive (but are not in full combat).  They can lead the animals away, play with them, and do other non-aggressive actions involving the animals.  
    * Animal Empathy does not confer any ability to actually speak with animals in a way they understand, only to calm and physically interact with them.  
    * If another person is overly aggressive towards or attacks any of the animals the Animal Empathy immediately ends.

### Valdyr
------
  * Racial Makeup: The player must wear elf-style ears and "feathered" makeup around the eyes/eyebrows, hands, and jaw line.  Players may optionally wear cosmetic feather wings of any solid color (white, black, etc).

#### Racial Abilities:

  * **Invisibility**:
    * When against a large object (tree, wall, fence, etc) a character can steeple their hands above their head and become completely invisible and minor noises they unintentionally make are inaudible (must be ignored).  
    * They remain invisible until they lower their hands, intentionally make noise, or take a full step.  
  * **Resist Magic**:
    * When being impacted by something called with the **Magical** tagline the character can call "Resist Magic" and ignore the effect.

### Xenn
------
  * Pronounced: Zen
  * Racial Makeup: The player must wear small horns and must wear highlights of green and brown on all visible skin surfaces.

#### Racial Abilities:

  * **Empathic Healing**:
    * A character can touch another character and immediately heal a single Wound on another character (arm, leg, torso).  
    * This has no limit per two hours, but after the first time every time the character uses this ability before the two hour reset the character heals the Wound by taking the Wound on themselves in the same place (transferring the wound).  
    * The Wound transfer for using Empathic Healing more than once per two hours cannot be stopped by **any** means but can be healed normally.
  * **Forest Walk**:
    * Starting at a tree the character crosses their arms above their head (a letter X), palms open and can stand next to or walk directly between any trees unharmed.  
    * While they are using Forest Walk they are visible to everybody but ethereal (somewhat transparent/ghostlike).  
    * Nothing can harm them while their arms are crossed and nobody can try to stop their walking while they are using this ability.  
    * When using this ability players can only walk in a direct line between trees where they can see the base of the next tree and cannot walk through permanent structures like fences and houses.
