# Mythre LARP

Mythre is a simple [LARP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action_role-playing_game) designed for simplicity and originally targeted towards younger players (ages 10 - 17), their parents, and guardians.  At its core, Mythre is for live-action, dramatic storytelling where the rules are there to help build upon a character but not get in the way of the players actually telling their stories.

Mythre itself consists of the basic rules covering character's enchanted races and their special in-game abilities, from magic to combat.  There isn't a lot of front and back-matter that is present in other LARP handbooks because this isn't a game designed for 100+ players who need every possible in and out-of-game condition covered.  It is more the pick-up basketball game of LARPing.

As an intellectual project, this game would not exist without wisdom and insight from designing, writing for, staffing, and playing the various LARPs I have been involved with since the 1990s.  However, for the material as written here, there are a few primary sources of rules that I drew the most inspiration from: Adrian McLeer's "Forest of Doors" rules system, "Capes! Superhero LARP," Lurking Fear Productions' "Chaotic Fluidity" rules system, and Mike Haffey's "Young Dragons."  Along with all these sources was the input from William Kotas about his own experiences playing with and designing LARP rules systems which helped me let go of loved ideas that simply didn't fit.
