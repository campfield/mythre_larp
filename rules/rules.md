# General Rules

  * The most important rule is that all of the rules of Mythre are flexible.  If a Talent **occasionally** gets used in 5 minutes instead of waiting the required 10 minutes, that is fine.  If an ability can be used creatively with a Guide's approval, go with the creative use.  If Guides want to increase or decrease a listed value because it fits better with their game and players, change the value and let people know it has been changed.
  * If players use an in-game ability, such as "dodge" they must clearly call out the ability's tagline (if any).  This lets people understand what the character just did and that they are playing fair with abilities.
  * Players can strike with hand-held weapons like boffer swords at a rate of 1 hit per second, per weapon.  This prevents "machine-gunning" where people run up to each other and hitting as fast as possible in a way that people couldn't do if it was an actual weapon.  This also allows for combats to be longer and lets all the players have a chance to participate, not just the fastest.
  * Nerf-style guns and bows can be decorated but cannot have any internal changes to the physical mechanics of the firing system (removal of air restriction, change in springs or plungers, etc).  Nerf-style projectiles cannot be decorated but it is suggested that the player's initials are written on them in permanent marker.
  * Nerf-style guns must be manual (no batteries) and can have a maximum ammunition capacity of 8 darts before manual reloading, if a player is using a clip-based weapon the limit is still 8 rounds per clip and between clips players must wait 10 seconds for "cooldown."  Good example weapons are the  Nerf "N-Strike Maverick" and the Nerf "Rebelle Secrets & Spies Arrow Revolution Bow Blaster."
  * As stated in other sections, there are no rules related to armor.  Characters can wear armor as part of their costuming but it has no in-game mechanical use.  This is for rules simplicity and to help keep combat to be equally challenging to all players without the issue of "threat scaling" where creatures need to be sent out to challenge the most combat-focused that often immediately overpower non-combat-focused characters.
  * All LARP spell packets used for the various magical Traditions must be constructed of white, silver, or gold fabric.  These show up the best against the ground and at night when thrown.  All other colors are reserved for potential future use.


## Starting Equipment
  * Each character can start with any costuming and accessories they desire.  
  * Each character can start with three weapons from the choice of boffer weapons and Nerf-style guns/bows.

## Special Rules Exceptions
  * The Racial Ability: "Elemental Water: Nixie Charm" and the Spirit Virtue Talent "Silver Tongue" are **not** considered Mental effects.  This is for game balance and rules simplification reasons favoring the creativity of the players.
  * Heads, hands, and feet are not woundable locations.  This means if a person gets hit in these locations they don't take a Wound or need to use any defensive abilities.  However, spell packets hitting these areas do take effect.  Players cannot intentionally block using their heads, hands, or feet.

## Combat Basics

  * Mythre is a lightest touch boffer LARP with a few basic concepts:
    * Boffer weapon hits should be the lightest touch that is needed for someone else to feel the strike.

    * Don't use brute strength to push boffer weapons past an opponent's weapons.
    * Don't grab or fight each other with anything besides boffer weapons, Nerf-style weapons, and LARP packets.
    * Don't shoot Nerf-style weapons at people's heads **ever**.
    * Outside of weapon use, nobody is allowed to directly touch another person without express permission.  If a player don't have express permission, but need to use a skill such as a healing skill, work very close without actual touching.  
    * For minors, an adult guardian must grant permission **each game** for any person to touch the minor and adults can **never** directly touch minors in any location besides the tops of shoulders and the arms from elbows to finger tips.

## Wounds, Maladies, and Dying

### Wounds and Dying
Becoming wounded and healing those wounds are based on "Hit Location" rules common to many boffer LARPs.  

  * Each of limb and torso are treated as different targets.  If someone is hit in an area and they don't have some form of **toughness** to absorb the blow then that area is Wounded.  
  * The default damage from all weapons is 1 point.  Only damage above one point needs to be called out each attack.
  * Toughness is a barrier against being wounded gained from various sources.  Sources of damage remove the same amount of toughness.  If an attack does more damage than a character has in toughness, or they choose not to use their toughness, they take a Wound.
  * If a character solidly blocks a weapon blow with their own weapon but still gets hit, they do not take a Wound.
  * If something is Wounded, it can't be used, so if a leg is wounded they have to drop to a knee, if an arm is wounded it can't hold anything nor can it be used to cast magic.
  * If someone has **3** or more limb Wounds, or takes a single wound to their torso (hips to neck), they drop to the ground unconscious and start to bleed to death.
  * If healing has not started in 5 minutes of starting to bleed to death, the character dies.
  * Once healing starts, the countdown to death **pauses**.  Once the healing is finished the countdown towards death ends.
  * If healing is interrupted, the countdown towards dying starts from where it was paused.
  * If a character is Wounded in combat to where they have to go unconscious, but there is still fighting occurring, the character should take their weapons and move out of the way before going unconscious to prevent being stepped on.
  * If a character has toughness from different sources, Talents, Racial Abilities, etc, they choose the source of the toughness as it is used up.
  * Toughness is used when a player chooses to use it, so they can choose to take a Wound instead of using up their toughness, saving the toughness for a later point.


### Maladies
Maladies are a catch all for being diseased, poisoned, and all other types of debilitating sicknesses.
  * If a character has a Malady they cannot run, may only defend themselves in combat (may not use guns at all), cannot cast magic, or use any Talent that is physical in nature.
  * A character can use any Racial Abilities they know and any Talents that are not physical or magical.

### Dying
  * If a character dies, they wait silently for resurrection or a Guide or Wanderer to give them instructions on what to do next.  
  * If a character dies, unless rules specifically say so, when they come back to life Maladies are still present.

## Optional Rule(s):
  * After **1** hour of having Wounds or a Malady that are not directly leading to death, those Wounds and Maladies cure themselves.  This can be useful in games without a character with a healing-related skill present.
