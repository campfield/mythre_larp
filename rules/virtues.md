# Virtues

All characters have Virtues, core traits that set them apart and help define their character's personalities and exceptional qualities.  Virtues don't have to be qualities that the player possesses but are qualities of their character.  

## Rules
Virtues are grouped into three different types: Mind, Body, and Spirit.  Each Virtue chosen grants characters:
  * A choice of 2 Talents from that type of Virtue from that type's list.
  * Individual Virtues, such as Knowledge, Passion, and Finesse, **may** be used by Guides in ways not listed here.  For example, a Guide might say a character with the **Strength** Virtue is be able to move a very heavy object that a character without that Virtue could not move.  The character may try to move another heavy object but even having **Strength** is not enough.  These are not changes that add permanent abilities to the Virtue but ways to handle the many one-off edge cases that don't need their own page of hard-and-fast rules.
  * If a character knows a spell from a Tradition of Magic (Charms, Namings, and Weavings), they can use any magical scroll or object that is of that Tradition that they might encounter.  For example, a character who knows the "**Dragon's Breath**" spell from the Namings Tradition, but not the "**Phoenix's Flames**" spell from the Weavings Tradition, would be able to use a magical scroll with the title: "Namings: Skin of the Dancing Viper" but not a magic scroll with the title: "Weavings: Breath of the Eagle's Wings."

## Optional Rule(s):
  * Players may trade one Talent choice to cut the time between uses of a possessed Racial ability in half. So instead of waiting 2 hours between uses they only wait 1 hour (this can only be done once per Racial Ability).  
  * Players may trade one Talent choice to select an additional Racial Ability from their race's list.  Enchanted Humans may also choose their third Racial Ability in the same way.
  * Instead of the standard set of **2** Virtues for a Pathfinder the Guides may choose that all Pathfinders can choose **3** Virtues.  This is likely to be useful for games with a handful of players so there is a good coverage of useful Talents between the limited number of players.  
  * If several people do not show up for a game, Guides can grant players a one-game-only temporary Virtue selection so that important missing skills are available for that game.

## Mind Virtue
------


### Choose 2 of the Mind Talents below
  * "**Charms: Raven's Gaze**" Get 3 LARP-style packets per ten minutes that they can throw calling "Magical Raven's Gaze FEAR!" which causes the person hit with it to be stunned in fear.  They must first step back at least 5 steps from the character and cannot move towards them for 10 seconds (if the caster moves towards the target after casting this spell, the person under the effect of the spell does not have to continue moving back).  The character subjected to this spell can defend themselves and others but they cannot take offensive or aggressive actions for 10 seconds.  In addition a character can use this spell, still saying "Magical Raven's Gaze" to give themselves a protection from a Mental effect.  However, while the Mental protection is active they cannot summon the LARP packets for the fear effect, but they can choose to drop the Mental protection and immediately use the fear effect as normal.
  * "**Scholar**" After 5 minutes of "research" in a book, character gets very basic "filler" information about a topic from the people helping with the game.
  * "**Arcanist**" Can sense magic, tell if something is magical and the nature of the magic, can power a magic item or place by touching it and concentrating for 2 minutes (or time listed).
  * "**Beast Speaker**" Can speak with intelligent animals in very basic terms and they **may** answer back.
  * "**Empath**" Can remove the effect of a Mental condition impacting a character by talking for 15 seconds.

## Body Virtue
------

### Choose 2 of the Body Talents below
  * "**Namings: Dragon's Breath**" Get 3 LARP-style packets per ten minutes that they can throw calling "Magical Dragon's Breath 2!" for 2 points of damage each to the area hit.  In addition a character can concentrate for 30 seconds and call "Magical Dragon's Breath" to active and pass around a low-brightness green glow stick (sold in camping areas of stores and available as chemical and electrical) that last until they go out or are turned off (there is no limit to this ability just that 30 seconds is spent creating each).
  * "**Dodge**" Can call "dodge" to **any** one thing that hits them once per 10 minutes (ignoring the hit entirely).
  * "**Healer**" Can heal wounds and cure maladies by pretending to treat the patient for 1 minute and they will recover in 10 minutes or for 3 minutes and they recover in 5 minutes.
  * "**Crafter**" Can fix something that is "broken" after 1 minute work, 5 minutes if moderately complex, and 10 minutes if of major complexity.  This skill also lets them pick a lock by playing rock-paper-scissors.  An easy lock takes 2 out of 4 R.P.S. and a complex lock takes 3/5 R.P.S..  A single character's failure to pick a lock can be retried after 10 minutes.
  * "**Athelete**" Can exercise and stretch for 5 minutes and get 1 additional toughness against wounds **OR** resistance to the first Malady that impacts them, to be used during the game or 10 minutes to get 2 toughness and the resistance to a Malady (combat/sparring does not count as exercise).  No more than 2 toughness and 1 resistance to Maladies can be gained from this Talent at a time.


## Spirit Virtue
------

### Choose 2 of the Spirit Talents below
  * "**Weavings: Phoenix's Flames**" After concentrating and touching a dead character for 5 minutes and calling "Magical Phoenix's Flames" the dead character comes back to life.  If a character is not dead this spell can still be used (after 10 seconds instead of 5 minutes) and saying "Magical Phoenix's Flames" to bring them back to full health and wellness.  However, the previously dead or dying character can't use any Talents for 10 minutes after being brought back and can only fight to defend themselves, not fight to wound others (this spell cannot be used as an offensive spell meant to intentionally disable).  Characters can still use their Racial Abilities during the 10 minute recovery time.
  * "**Medium**" Can sense the presence of invisible things including hidden doors and are the only people who can see and talk to the dead **unless** the spirit has a blue neckband or glow necklace which means everybody can see and hear them.  People with Medium cannot see or reveal invisible things, simply sense they are somewhere nearby.
  * "**Serene Form**" During any activity that involves tasks like jumping, climbing, traps, dodging (not combat) they may ignore a single failure by saying "Serene Form." Once used they must wait 10 minutes to use this Talent again.
  * "**Silver Tongue**" After saying something they didn't mean to say they can "undo" what they **just** said by saying "Silver Tongue."  Everybody must pretend like the character didn't say what was just before "Silver Tongue" being said.  This can be used once every 10 minutes and is not a Mental effect.
  * "**Storyteller**" Can weave a newly created spoken tale taking at least 5 minutes and at the end the character will receive cryptic visions of the past, present, and future.  If other characters take part in the telling and extending of the same story, adding their own 3 minutes to the story, everybody who participated receives their own cryptic visions.  This ability can only be used once every few hours at the **Guides'** discretion.
