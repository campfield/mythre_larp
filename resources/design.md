# Design Concepts

For simplicity during game all characters are called **Pathfinders**, staff are called **Guides**, and other people helping with the game (but without official staff duties) are called **Wanderers**.

## Keep it Simple Stupid (KISS)
  * There is only a small set of things a player needs to know:
    * Their own character's backstory.
    * Their own in-game abilities and how they work.
    * The small number of in-game effects that might be used on them.
  * As a minimalistic LARP many skills and rules found in many other boffer LARPs are intentionally absent, mostly to remove abilities that have traditionally led to many edge cases, awkward "fixes," and confusion.  There are no complicated crafting or social rules, "haste," "erase memories," shields, armor, threshold, dozens of unique spells, and other tidbits that add interesting flavor and hundreds of pages to handbooks.
  * In game abilities don't interact in complex ways, but **can** be used creatively.
    * If there are ways characters' abilities could interact in unexpected ways they don't, **period**.
  * If an ability doesn't specifically say a character can do something with that ability, they can't do it without a Guide saying it can be used in a different way.

## Keep it fun
  * Mythre is intended to be a [Player vs. Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_versus_environment) game as opposed to [Player vs. Player](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_versus_player).  
  * The goal isn't to dominate every discussion, win every battle, or to never stumble and fall.  If a person can never fail, success has no value.
  * Stay in-character whenever possible, breaking out of character can hurt everybody's immersion.
  * If someone isn't playing by the rules, let a Guide or Wanderer know but try to not let it stop play or break character immersion.
  * In the end, treat everybody with respect and realize it is all simply pretend.
