# Boffer Weapons

## Melee Weapons

Boffer weapon construction can be complicated and specifications vary dramatically from
game to game.  In essence boffer weapons are intended to be padded enough so they are non-painful
when hitting another person.  

It is suggested that starting players being games with pool-noodle
based weapons.  These can be easily created with [Canoodle](https://www.amazon.com/Canoodle-toy-Twin-Sword-Handle/dp/B00FXV9UIO)
sword handles and an off-the-shelf pool noodles.  For more of a customizable weapon, it is
suggested to use weapons built to the [AMTGARD](http://amtgard.com/how-to-build-a-sword) specification.

Nerf N-Force Swords, and similar off the shelf toys, are **not** suggested as they have minimal padding, sharp points, and firm cores.

## Spell Packets

Constructing spell packets is simple and many can be made for under $8 using cheap fabric, bird seed, and rubber bands.  There are numerous detailed guildes online, but the only requirement is that rice is not used as it can absorb water, swell, and make the packets strike hard.
