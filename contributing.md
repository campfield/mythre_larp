# Contributing


Writing, especially games writing, is a perilous task - especially when the writer is also the editor.  
The writer thinks they see
all of the components laid neatly on paper but often forgets the
bits and pieces that reside only in their mind that fill in the glaring holes.  
Worse, as a set of rules is tweaked, themes altered, or components swapped back
and forth to attempt to create balance, not-so-subtle issues are inserted that the
creator cannot see since they are the one who created the issue in the first
place.

Any errors, rules weirdness, ability issues, missing/assumed knowledge can be
resolved with a git pull request at https://github.com/campfield/mythre_larp.
If you are not familiar with using git and github, please drop any suggested
changes or updates to **mythreorg@gmail.com**.

I'd appreciate any changes that you think would improve this little project.



## Settings

Eventually I plan on adding some very base settings to start games with, a description
of a few nations and cultures to start from, some common types of "monsters," descriptions of
mythical beings, and a map or two.  Any contributions to this in terms of personal
creativity would be appreciated.
